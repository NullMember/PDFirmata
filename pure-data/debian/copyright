  NOTE: This routine uses at least 2 patented algorithms, and may be
        under the restrictions of a bunch of different organizations.
        Although I wrote it completely myself, it is kind of a derivative
        of a routine I once authored and released under the GPL, so it
        may fall under the free software foundation's restrictions;
        it was worked on as a Stanford Univ project, so they claim
        some rights to it; it was further optimized at work here, so
        I think this company claims parts of it.  The patents are
        held by R. Bracewell (the FHT algorithm) and O. Buneman (the
        trig generator), both at Stanford Univ.
        If it were up to me, I'd say go do whatever you want with it;
        but it would be polite to give credit to the following people
        if you use this anywhere:
            Euler     - probable inventor of the fourier transform.
            Gauss     - probable inventor of the FFT.
            Hartley   - probable inventor of the hartley transform.
            Buneman   - for a really cool trig generator
            Mayer(me) - for authoring this particular version and
                        including all the optimizations in one package.
        Thanks,
        Ron Mayer; mayer@acuson.com
