Quick compilation instructions for GNU/Linux, Mac OS X, or Windows if you have
installed MinGW or Cygwin: make sure "automake" is installed as well as the usual C
compiler chain. Then in this directory, run the following commands:

    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure
    make

If you need jack support, add the corresponding flag to "configure":

    ./configure --enable-jack

See the ./configure help print for other options such as a multi architecture
(universal) build, etc:

    ./configure --help

If made this way, Pd will not run until it has been "installed", either via
$ sudo make install or, for instance, $ make install DESTDIR=~/pd-xxx prefix=/

Alternatively, and often more simply, you can use the fallback makefiles in
"src" for gnu/linux, Mac OSX, or Microsoft Visual C. On linux, for example, cd
to src and type "make -f makefile.gnu".  You can then run directly out of the
pd/bin directory without even having to do the "install" step.

Special instructions for Microsoft Visual C: cd to src and type "make -f
makefile.msvc". Then cd to the various subdirs of extra and type "make pd_nt" in
each.

Various dependencies:

- in Linux and Mac you need Tcl/Tk
    (apparently always present for Mac and usually there for Linux).

- On linux you may also need:
    - the ALSA "dev" package:
        $ yum install alsa-lib-devel
    or
        $ sudo apt-get install libasound2-dev
    - the JACK "dev" package:
        $ yum install jack-audio-connection-kit-devel
    or
        $ sudo apt-get install libjack-dev
    or
        $ sudo apt-get install libjack-jackd2-dev)
    - libtool (if using the "autogen" method):
        $ sudo apt-get install libtool
