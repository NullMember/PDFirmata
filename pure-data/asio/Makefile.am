# The ASIO sources are not free, so they are not included here.  You can get
# them for free (as in beer) from Steinberg:

# http://www.steinberg.net/en/company/developers.html

# First, download the ASIO SDK. You have to agree to Steinberg's license, then
# submit an email address, then they'll send you the download URL in an
# email. Download the asiosdk2.3.zip file to the pd/asio directory, then unzip
# it right into that folder.  You should have all of the ASIO files in
# pd/asio/ASIOSDK2 when you are done unzipping.

# this is built as a "libtool convenience library"
