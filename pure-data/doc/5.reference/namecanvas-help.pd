#X text 24 140 This is sometimes the only way to send a message to
a canvas when making graph-on-parent abstractions \, but its use in
making self-editing patches is dangerous since if you use it to edit
the namecanvas itsef away you can cause Pd to crash. Instead \, you
can just say:;
#X msg 28 55 \; bonzo msg 280 50 hi there;
#X msg 28 227 \; pd-namecanvas-help.pd msg 280 80 this is safer but
only possible if you know the name of the canvas in advance.;
