This is the README file for Pd, a free real-time computer music software
package resembling Max.

You can get Pd for Linux, Mac OS X, or MS Windows from:

    http://msp.ucsd.edu/software.html

Installation instructions are in the HTML DOCUMENTATION at:

    http://msp.ucsd.edu/Pd_documentation/index.htm

If you download and unpack Pd, you will also find the html documentation
locally in the file ".../pd-whatever/doc/1.manual/index.htm".

Linux (or FreeBSD): in some Linux installations you can download Pd via
"apt-get install puredata" or "yum install puredata"; otherwise you will have to
download the source and compile it as described in the file "INSTALL.txt".

Microsoft Windows: Pd binaries are distributed as a "zip" file. Unzip this,
creating a directory such as "\pd".

Macintosh: Pd binaries are distributed as a "tar.gz" file. The web browser will
automatically download this archive into your Downloads folder. Double click
to extract the archived Mac app which you can then run and/or drag into your
Applications folder.

If you have questions about Pd, or if you wish to be notified of releases,
check the Pd mailing list:

    http://lists.puredata.info/listinfo

Many extensions to Pd are available, notably for handling video and 3D
graphics; see the html documentation for pointers.
